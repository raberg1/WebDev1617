        <h1 class="lab">Lab 3: Serving your files on GitHub</h1>
        <div class="lab-intro">
            <p class="lab-intro">To this point we have been previewing our pages on Cloud9.  GitHub has its own server to simplify this process, but we need to understand how they are interconnected.</p>
            <p class="lab-intro">In this lab you will confirm that you can host your pages on GitHub, which is the same as what we did yesterday in class.</p>
            <p class="lab-intro">This lab is intended to give each student an opportunity to make up points that they may have missed in class yesterday. If you complete part 2, then you will receive full points for yesterday's work.  Part 3 will also go into the gradebook as a new assignment worth 3 points.  You must complete both in class today or by midnight tonight.  No late work will be accepted.</p>
            <p class="lab-intro">The <strong>accomplishment</strong> we're going for is that you understand how to work with c9, Git and GitHub. Make sure to take some time to understand what you're doing in each step; you'll be working with these tools all semester (and possibly beyond.)</p>
            <p class="lab-intro">If at any point you get confused, ask around you for someone who has already completed the assignment.  If that does not help, then bring your computer back to Mr. Berg.  Start over if you need to.</p>

                </ul>
                <li>If everything is working properly, navigate to: https://&lt;github account name>.github.io/webdevs2/labs/lab3.html</li>
